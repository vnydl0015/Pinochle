Pinochle is a trick-taking card game played with a special deck of 48 cards.  The deck consists of two copies of each card from 9 to Ace in all four suits (♠️♣️♦️♥️). Other cards are not used in the game.

Pinochle gameplay has the following steps:

Dealing: Each player gets a set number of cards from the deck.
Bidding: Players bid to decide who will set the trump suit (a powerful suit in the game).
Melding: Players show special card combinations called melds to earn points.
Trick-Taking: Players play a card in their hands to win the trick.
Scoring: Players earn points through melding and trick-taking. A penalty applies if the bid winner fails to earn the number of points they bid.
